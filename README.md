# Simple Chatty Bot

[Simple Chatty Bot](https://hyperskill.org/projects/113) provides the very basics of Java syntax, including variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

Code sample:

```
Hello! My name is Dennis.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
Elon Musk

What a great name you have, Elon Musk!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
1 0 4

Your age is 25; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
5

0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Congratulations, that's correct!
Congratulations Elon Musk, you are 25 years old. Have a nice day!
